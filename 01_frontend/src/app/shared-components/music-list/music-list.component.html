        East is up, I’m fearless when I hear this on the low East is up, I’m
        careless when I wear my rebel clothes East is up, when Bishops come
        together they will know that Dema don’t control us, dema don’t control
        East is up They want to make you forget They want to make you forget
        Save your razorblades now, not yet Save your razorblades now, not yet
        I’m heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady I’m lighter when I’m lower, I’m
        higher when I’m heavy, oh I’m so high, my jumpsuit takes me so high I’m
        flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh East is up, I’m
        fearless when I hear this on the low East is up, I’m careless when I
        wear my rebel clothes East is up, when Bishops come together they will
        know that Dema don’t control us, dema don’t control I'm heavy, my
        jumpsuit is on steady I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm
        heavy, oh I'm so high, my jumpsuit takes me so high I'm flying from a
        fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh I'm heavy, jumpsuit is on steady
        Lighter when I'm lower, higher when I'm heavy, oh I'm so high, I'm so
        high So high, I'm so high Fire, Nico and the Niners What I say when I
        want to be enough What a beautiful day for making a break for it We'll
        find a way to pay for it Maybe from all the money we made razorblade
        stores Rent a race horse and force a sponsor And start a concert, a
        complete diversion Start a mob and you can be quite certain We'll win
        but not everyone will get out No, no We'll win but not everyone will get
        out No, no We'll win but not everyone will get out East is up, I'm
        fearless when I hear this on the low East is up, I'm careless when I
        wear my rebel clothes East is up, when Bishops come together they will
        know that Dema don't control us, dema don't control East is up I'm so
        high, so high Fire, Nico and the Niners I'm so high, so high Fire, Nico
        and the Niners
